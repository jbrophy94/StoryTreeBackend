This is the backend for a react based app with which users can build simple text based RPG games.

This simple implementation focuses on a decision tree structure (or an 'Event' based structure).

Notably, NPCs are just imagined through the text within each event, and their attributes are reflected in
the event roll modifiers. 

In a later version of this tool, we may implement an NPCCharacter class--but given our reliance on the event tree structure, this is added complexity is not worth it at this time.
